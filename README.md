# Perl Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Perl: division by zero. The `bug.pl` file contains a script that attempts to divide a number by zero, leading to an exception. The `bugSolution.pl` file provides a corrected version that handles potential division by zero errors gracefully.
